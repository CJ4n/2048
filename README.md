# 2048
My implementation of 2048 (game), written in WinAPI

Game 2048 written in WinAPI (C++). It should behave very similarly to the original game.
The game has a save game state feature. If you leave a game, the game state (squares, points, game goal) will be saved and then loaded on game startup.
NOTE: Game state is saved in .file.ini, so if you delete it, then, obviously, the game won't be loaded, though nothing bad should happen either.
